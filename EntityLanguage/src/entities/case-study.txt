=Entities language case study=

==Setup==

For following the case study You need the NetBeans IDE (the plugin was tested on 7.4, but should be working on any version since 7.0). Downloadable at: https://netbeans.org/downloads/

Checking out the SVN repository of this project will provide You with a NetBeans project named _EntityLanguage_. In the project directory under the `src` You will find the _EDSLAddon_ NetBeans plugin ('EDSLAddon.nbm', the project site is https://code.google.com/p/edsl-addon/ ). How to install it You will find at: http://wiki.netbeans.org/InstallingAPlugin

==Goal==

The goal of the case study is to implement homogeneous embedded DSL (hEDSL) for CRUD applications, and to use the EDSLAddon along with hEDSL language manipulations to make the language more usable for *non-programming* domain experts. The main role in this experiment will play NetBeans IDE.

The language should support writing down entities with their properties, and with constraints laid upon properties. The semantics of the language will not be implemented here, suffice to say that in the final version the language would be able to generate a skeleton of a CRUD application working with defined entities.

An example of the language sentence defining a simple Hospital:

{{{
entity Patient
   property name string required length (5, 30)
   property age integer range (0, 120)
}}}

==Entities language model==

First step is implementing a language semantic model ( http://martinfowler.com/dslCatalog/semanticModel.html ). The model is implemented as Java classes.

You can find the Entities language model in the `entities.language.metamodel` package of the _EntityLanguage_ NetBeans project. There are quite logical language concepts: an entity and a property, both named, the type of the property and finally the whole model. The constraints that can be set upon the properties are implemented in the `entities.language.metamodel.constraints` package. All the source codes have JavaDoc comments explaining them in more details.

==Entities expression builder==

The first version of the expression builder we implemented with nested functions pattern ( http://blog.sanaulla.info/2013/05/30/creating-internal-dsls-in-java-java-8-adopting-martin-fowlers-approach/ ).

The expression builder is the `entities.language.builder.StaticEntityBuilder`. This class mediates the creation of the language semantic model through its static methods (functions) thus simplifying its creation. A simple hEDSL sentence written with this expression builder is `entities.models.HospitalStatic`.

`entities.models.HospitalStatic` (without comments):

{{{
package entities.models;

import entities.language.builder.StaticEntityBuilder;
import static entities.language.builder.StaticEntityBuilder.*;
import entities.language.metamodel.Model;

public class HospitalStatic {
    
    public void compose() {
        entity("Patient",
                property("name", string, required(), length(5, 30)),
                property("age", integer, range(0, 120))
        );
    }
    
    public Model getModel() {
        return StaticEntityBuilder.getModel();
    }
}
}}}

The main part that can be expected to be of the domain expert's interest is the body of the compose method. The rest is just Java syntactic noise required to compile and to mediate the model to the rest of the infrastructure. The model creation is teste in `entities.Main`.

==Using _EDSLAddon_ DSL template for sentence skeleton==

You can create a new sentence by using a Entities DSL template (this, and following steps require installed _EDSLAddon_). In the NetBeans IDE right-click on the `entities.models` package of the _EntityLanguage_ project. Select `New` and `Other` in the `New File` dialog select the `DSL` category and there the `Entities homogeneous EDSL sentence`. Click `Next` and in the `Filename` text box fill in the name of a new hEDSL sentence (e.g. "School").

The _EDSLAddon_ will generate a skeleton with an example of an entity definition.

==_EDSLAddon_ syntactic noise reduction==

As You can see, the user is already presented a less polluted syntax. You will see the following:

{{{
Define entities and their properties here:
        entity("Foo",
                property("Bar", string, required(), length(0, 20)),
                property("Bar2", real)
        );
Definition ends here.
}}}

The first and last line are collapsed folds hiding the necessary skeleton of the Entities hEDSL sentence. This skeleton is Java syntactic noise and thus we hide it from user. To prevent the inexpert manipulation the folds are also guarded.

For *non-programmer* domain experts only the middle part is important. uarding and hiding of the rest is not a problem. Non-programmers will most probably not be able to modify the skeleton without messing it. For a programmer this might seem a restriction, but he will be skilled enough to overcome it by opening it in other editor. For a non-programmer this skeleton is a law. If an error rises, *they* messed up (in the `compose` method body). They should not use any other parts of Java except the Entities hEDSL.

==Smart code completion support==

If You check the new Entities expression builder, the `entities.language.builder.EntityBuilder` class, You will notice that it uses the object scoping technique ( http://martinfowler.com/dslCatalog/objectScoping.html ). Instead of static methods it uses instance methods, and the expression builder class is an abstract class, with the abstract `compose()` method. A sentence in the Entities hEDSL is now a class extending the `EntityBuilder` class.

Although it deals with global functions and global state, the other reason why we have used it is a Smart Code Completion of the NetBeans IDE. This is a language manipulation, since this will work even without the _EDSLAddon_ installed (the plain NetBeans IDE will suffice).

If You go back to the `entities.models.HospitalStatic` Hospital definition with static methods, You can try to use code completion (Ctrl + Space). You will see

==Error reporting with navigation==

The case study also uses a language manipulation that helps to reuse the IDE. This step will work even without the _EDSLAddon_ installed. For error reporting with navigation to source of the error we have implemented the `error.reporting.ErrorHandlingUtils` class.

The `error.reporting.ErrorHandlingUtils` class has a simple API. Its constructor has to be passed to a class of the expression builder (in our case the `entities.language.builder.EntityBuilder`). Then, each creation method that will be used by the language user to create a semantic model object has to register the created object with the `registerObject(T object)` method. Then, if validation detects an error with some object, the `reportError` is used to navigate the user to the problem object.

The example of using this approach with the `error.reporting.ErrorHandlingUtils` class is our `entities.language.builder.EntityBuilder` expression builder. The `EntityBuilder` class has a simple validation method that reports entities and properties duplications. Try to define a sentence with two entities with the same name in the newly created `entities.models.School` sentence:

{{{
Define entities and their properties here:
        entity("Teacher",
                property("name", string, required(), length(0, 20)),
                property("income", real)
        );
        entity("Teacher"
        );
Definition ends here.
}}}

Then add to the `entities.Main.main(String[] args)` method the following line:

{{{
new entities.models.School().compose();
}}}

If You run the _EntityLanguage_ project (e.g., right-click on the project and `Run`), You will get the following error to the output:

{{{
Defined duplicate entity with name Teacher
	 at entities.models.School.define(School.java:15)
}}}

The user is told not only what is the problem, but is also navigated by the `at entities.models.School.define(School.java:15)` line. It tells him that the problem is at `School` class on the line 15. The nice part is that the string `School.java:15` is clickable and clicking on it will open the file in the editor and put the cursor at that line.
